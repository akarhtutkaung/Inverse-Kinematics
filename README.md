## Summary
This program implements the inverse kinematics to move around the joints of the character. We use 2 different type of inverse kinematics algorithm, CCD, and FABRIK.

- Single-arm IK
- Multi-arm IK

- Joint limits

- User Interaction
  - User can select which arms/legs they would like to move

- Moving IK
  - User can move the character itself using arrow keys

- Re-rooting IK
  - User can toggle craw action by pressing *space* bar and move the character around to make it look like crawling

- Alternative IK Solver
